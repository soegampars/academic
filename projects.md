# Current Projects

## Inisiatif Data (Beneran) Terbuka

> "Open Data Initiative (For Real)"

This project houses all economic data I previously used in my research, focusing on Indonesian economic statistics.

### About the Project

I run this project in my spare time to create a comprehensive, accessible database of Indonesian economic data. The name "Beneran Terbuka" (meaning "Really Open" in Indonesian) emphasizes our commitment to true data transparency.

### Data Sources

These data are mostly scraped from the PDF publications of Indonesian Badan Pusat Statistik (*Central Statistical Bureau*). Our scraping and cleaning process ensures that this valuable information is more accessible and usable for researchers and analysts.

Check this project out on GitHub: [https://github.com/soegampars/idbt](https://github.com/soegampars/idbt)
